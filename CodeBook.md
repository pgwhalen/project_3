The descriptions of variables apply to both data frames `tidy_data` and `tidy_data_avgs`, though since tidy_data_avgs is grouped by subject and activity, the values are averages for that subject and activity, as opposed to one value for each window sample.

All observations are keyed by `subject.id` (which represents which subject the observation is for), and `activity` which is a representation of the activity the subject was doing.

The features included in these data are broadly grouped into two categories, "time" (those prepended by "t") and "frequency" (those prepended by "f").  The time variables were captured at a rate of 50 per second, and the frequency variables were calculated by applying a fast fourier transform to the data raw.  For each base variable (bodyAccJerk for example) there may be values in all dimensions (X, Y, Z) as well as a magnitude (Mag).  And for each of these variables, the mean and standard deviation ("std") are present.  Here is the full list of variables in the data frames:
